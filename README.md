## User Experience

* User Stories
I decided to redevelop the classic snake game to the new generations. Being the only game on the early mobile phones, I decided to try and reimagine this for people who have not experienced this game before. 

## Wireframes  
##Need to be added

## Design 
I choose the black background with the red writing to make the title really stand out. 
The green and yellow background for the actual game, with the black snake and red food is distintive so the user can clearly see the icons 

## Colour Scheme  

## Images 

## Icons 
I have used icon buttons for the user to control the snake these are on green on a black background to stand out 

## Features  

 

### Current Features  

I have created a game that is fully responsive on all screen sizes eg Tablet Mobile Laptop. This allows the texts and images to translate properly on these devices. 

### Interactive Elements  

I have created clickable buttons so that the user can move the snake around to get the food 

## Technologies Used  

### Languages used 

* HTML 5 and CSS 3  JavaScript 

### Frameworks and Library Programs 
####  Git  

Git was used as version control in terminal  
####  Gitpod  

Gitpod was used to create my files and where I wrote the code.  

##Errors
